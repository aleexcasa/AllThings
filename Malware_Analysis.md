## What does Malware dtand for?

Malware stats for **Mal**icious Soft**ware** and is any software that is used for malicious intents.

The most common goals can be categorized into:

- Disrupting host system operations
- Stealing critical information, such as personal and financial datt
- Obtaining unauthorized access
- Espionage
- Sending Spam
- Utilizing the victim's system
- Locking up victim's files on a host and holding them for ransomware

## What is Malware Analysis?

Malware Analysis is the art of dissecting malicious software with the objective of answering three main Qs:

- How does it work
- How can we detect it?
- How can we defeat and eliminate the threat it creates?

## Why is important?

There are many reasons why malware analysis is important, especially when determining:

- The nature of the malware and its goals.
- What behavior and damage it causes.
- What indicators could help detect the malware on systems or during its network communication.
- What vulnerabilities were exploited on the compromised machine and how the attacker moved laterally in the network.
- Who the threat is attributed to and if the threat actors still have a foothold on the system/network.
- How to respond to and eliminate the threat.

## What is the difference between malware analysis and reverse engineering?

While Malware Analysis can involve Reverse Engineering, it doea not mean you can't analyze malware without RE. Reverse engineering is the art of dissecting a product to understand its blueprint or how it was made.

## What are some of the basic tools used in malware analysis?

Tools change all the time, but concepts remain the same.
Common tools include:
- File Format Analyzers
- System and Network Monitoring Tools
- Debugger and Disassemblers
- Smal Gadgets: data converters, decryptors, editors, registry tools, etc.
- Virtualization Tools to create contained enviroments
- A good IDE if you need to write code

## What about writing signatures?

After you finish analyzing a malware sample, you can the write signatures that can help detect the same or similar samples running on other systems.

We refer to these as "**Indicator of Compromise**" or IOCs.

## Why is Malware Analysis important for businesses?

Most of the breaches involve a threat actor planting malicious software to gain a foothold in compromised enviroments.

## Types of Malware

### Virus

A type of malware that infects the target with the intervention of the user to copy itself and spread to other computers or systems.

### Worm

Similar to a virus, it is a malicious software that infects the victim's machine, but it differs from a virus in its ability to spread itself without intervention or help from the user.

### Scareware

A type of malware that uses the skills of social engineering malware to trick a user into buying or downloading unwanted software or rogue security software which pretends to be antivirus software.

### Ransomware

A type of malware that locks the victim's
